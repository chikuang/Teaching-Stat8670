# Monte Carlo Simulation and Variance Reduction

Monte Carlo (MC) integration is a simulation-based method for *approximating integrals* using random sampling.

In numerical integration, methods such as the trapezoidal rule use a *deterministic approach*. MC integration, on the other hand, employs a *non-deterministic* approach: each realization provides a different outcome.
