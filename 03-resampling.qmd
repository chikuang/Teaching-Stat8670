# Resampling, Jackknife and Bootstrap

\newcommand{\bx}{\mathbf{x}}

## Introduction

This chapter covers resampling methods including the jackknife and bootstrap techniques.

## Jackknife

The jackknife is a resampling technique used to estimate the bias and variance of a statistic.

Jackknife is like a **leave-one-out cross-validation**. Let $\bx= (x_1,\dots,x_n)$ be an observed random sample, and denote the $i$th jackknife sample by $\bx_{-i} = (x_1,\dots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\dots,x_n)$, that is, a subset of $\mathbf{x}$.

For the parameter of interest $\theta$, if the statistics is $T(\bx)=:\hat{\theta}$ is computed on the full

### When does jackknife not work?

Jackknife does not work when the function $T(\cdot)$ is **not a smooth** functional!

## Bootstrap

The bootstrap is a resampling method that allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using random sampling methods.

## Applications

These methods are widely used in statistical inference and have applications in various fields.
